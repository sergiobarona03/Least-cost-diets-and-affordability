abstract = {Abstract Objectives: To estimate the cost and affordability of healthy diets recommended by the 2016–2020 Vietnamese food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). Design: Cross-sectional analysis. The Cost of a Healthy Diet (CoHD) indicator was used to estimate the lowest cost of healthy diets and compare the cost differences by food group, region and seasonality. The affordability of healthy diets was measured by further comparing the CoHD to food expenditures and incomes. Setting: Food prices of 176 food items from January 2016 to December 2020 were derived using data from monthly Consumer Price Index databases nationally and regionally. Participants: Food expenditures and incomes of participants from three latest Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys were used. Results: The average CoHD between 2016 and 2020 in Vietnam was 3·08 international dollars using 2017 Purchasing Power Parity (24 070 Vietnamese Dongs). The nutrient-rich food groups, including protein-rich foods, vegetables, fruits and dairy, comprised approximately 80 % of the total CoHD in all regions, with dairy accounting for the largest proportion. Between 2016 and 2020, the cheapest form of a healthy diet was affordable for all high-income and upper-middle-income households but unaffordable for approximately 70 % of low-income households, where adherence to the Vietnamese FBDG can cost up to 70 % of their income. Conclusions: Interventions in local food systems must be implemented to reduce the cost of nutrient-rich foods to support the attainment of healthier diets in the Vietnamese population, especially for low-income households.},

abstract = {&NA; Policies and programs often aim to improve the affordability of nutritious diets, but existing food price indexes are based on observed quantities that may not meet nutritional goals. To measure changes in the cost of reaching international standards of diet quality, we introduce a new cost of diet diversity index based on the lowest‐cost way to include at least five different food groups as defined by the widely used minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD‐W) indicator and compare that to a Cost of Nutrient Adequacy indicator for the lowest‐cost way to meet estimated average requirements of essential nutrients and dietary energy. We demonstrate application of both indexes using national average monthly prices from two very different sources: an agricultural market information system in Ghana (2009‐14) and the data used for national consumer price indexes in Tanzania (2011‐15). We find that the cost of diet diversity index for Ghana fluctuated seasonally and since mid‐2010 rose about 10% per year faster than national inflation, due to rising relative prices for fruit, which also drove up the cost of nutrient adequacy. In Tanzania there were much smaller changes in total daily costs, but more adjustment in the mix of food groups used for the least‐cost diet. These methods can show where and when nutritious diets are increasingly (un)affordable, and which nutritional criteria account for the change. These results are based on monthly national average prices, but the method is generalizable to other contexts for monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of changing food environments.},

abstract = {This study examines the cost and affordability of healthy diets in Nigeria. Using the 2015/16 and 2018/19 waves of Nigeria General Household Surveys, we find that, generally, the least-cost options to meet dietary recommendations for vegetables, dairy, and protein-rich foods are more expensive to meet than that of other food groups. Despite improvements during the survey years, the challenges of affordability of healthy diets appear more pronounced in rural than urban, among poorest household groups, and in northern than southern Nigeria. Results suggest that it will be more expensive to meet the dietary recommendation for dairy foods if priority will be given for food systems sustainability over concerns for food preferences of the households. It will however be cheaper to achieve dietary recommendations for vegetables, fruits and starchy staples even when households give more consideration to food systems sustainability than tastes and preferences in their choice of healthy foods. Relative affordability of protein-rich foods are less affected by whether (or not) tastes/preferences or food systems sustainability drives healthy food choices. Key implication is that interventions targeting on affordability of healthy diets should give greater attention to the poorest of the poor, to rural than urban, and to northern than southern Nigeria. Implications relevant for research, policy, and other actors that focus on transformation of the food systems toward achieving healthier diets in a sustainable food systems are discussed.},

abstract = {The cost of diet has been recognized as a major determinant of overall diet quality and nutritional outcomes. We aimed to estimate the minimum cost and affordability of the recommended diet based on the updated food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) in Bangladesh. To compute the cost of the recommended diet (CoRD), we collected retail prices of foods corresponding to each of the food groups in the latest Bangladeshi FBDG. For affordability, the household size and daily food expenditure data were used from the most recent Household Income and Expenditure survey (HIES). The CoRD was calculated based on the average number of servings recommended for each food group; the CoRD was adjusted by a deflation factor and divided by the household’s daily food expenditure to estimate affordability. We found that the CoRD was $0.87 (83 BDT) per person per day at the national level. Nationally, about 43% of households could not afford the CoRD, with rural areas bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. We also found households to overspend on starchy staples while underspending on protein-rich foods, fruits, and dairy. These findings highlight the need for immediate implementation of interventions to improve the affordability of the CoRD and redesign policy instruments to create a sustainable food system.},

abstract = {Synchronized food retail prices raise seasonal peaks in the cost of nutritious diets, revealing new ways to improve food systems. Seasonal fluctuations in food prices reflect interactions between climate and society, measuring the degree to which predictable patterns of crop growth and harvest are offset by storage and trade. Previous research on seasonality in food systems has focused on specific commodities. This study accounts for substitution between items to meet nutritional needs, computing seasonal variation in local food environments using monthly retail prices for 191 items across Ethiopia, Malawi, and Tanzania from 2002 through 2016. We computed over 25,000 least-cost diets meeting nutrient requirements at each market every month and then measured the magnitude and timing of seasonality in diet costs. We found significant intensity in Malawi, Tanzania, and Ethiopia (10.0, 6.3, and 4.0%, respectively), driven primarily by synchronized price rises for nutrient-dense foods. Results provide a metric to map nutritional security, pointing to opportunities for more targeted investments to improve the year-round delivery of nutrients.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Background The respective roles of plant- and animal-sourced foods in sustainable healthy diets for humans remain unclear. Nutritional quality and the monetary cost of diets are key criteria among others for sustainable food production. Objective Linear programming (LP) was used to determine the composition of nutritionally adequate dietary patterns formulated at the lowest cost. The hypothesis tested was that animal-sourced foods would be included in least-cost diets due to their high density of particular essential nutrients. Methods The LP modeling work was based on eating patterns, retail food prices (2020), and the daily energy (11,150 kJ, 2665 kcal) and essential nutrient requirements (29 nutrients in total) of a reference adult in New Zealand (NZ). The LP modeling approach is publicly and freely available to readily illustrate the change in dietary profiles and daily diet cost, in the simulation of changes in energy and nutrient requirements, and price fluctuations within food groups. Results A nutrient-adequate, least-cost dietary pattern formulated from 883 foods, with a daily cost of NZ $3.23, included both animal- and plant-based foods. The nutrients found to be equally first-limiting were biotin, calcium, molybdenum, potassium, selenium, vitamin A, pantothenic acid, and vitamin C. When a dietary scenario with no animal-sourced foods was modeled, by increasing the retail prices of animal-sourced foods by 1.05 to 10.3 times, the daily cost of this plant-only dietary pattern was NZ $4.34. Additional nutrients, such as zinc, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D, were met at their daily minimum required levels. Conclusions Dietary patterns formulated at the lowest cost and meeting the daily minimum requirements for energy and essential nutrients for an adult in New Zealand relied on foods sourced from animals and plants.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective. To assess the ability of low-income families to obtain a standard basket of healthy foods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The costs of 191 food items were averaged from supermarkets, municipal markets, wholesalers, and community food outlets in high- and low-income areas in three Caribbean countries. The analysis compared foods not only by selecting high- and low-ranked commodities but by the proportions of those foods, by food group, that will be required to meet a low-cost, nutritionally balanced diet of 2 400 kcal. Results. The main finding was that low-income households will need between 22% and 47% of their earnings to obtain a healthy diet. Despite higher food prices in Saint Kitts and Nevis, low-income households there will need a smaller proportion of their income to obtain a similar basket of foods than in Jamaica or Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Conclusions. While the COVID-19 pandemic has added economic stressors to low-income households the basic vulnerability of the poor to obtain a healthy diet remains. Despite country variations, the findings point to the need for an increase in the minimum wage, particularly in Jamaica. It is essential to embed policies that ensure reduced economic and social vulnerability at the household level.},

abstract = {Rapid increases in food supplies have reduced global hunger, while rising burdens of diet-related disease have made poor diet quality the leading cause of death and disability around the world. Today's"double burden"of undernourishment in utero and early childhood then undesired weight gain and obesity later in life is accompanied by a third less visible burden of micronutrient imbalances. The triple burden of undernutrition, obesity, and unbalanced micronutrients that underlies many diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and other cardiometabolic disorders often coexist in the same person, household and community. All kinds of deprivation are closely linked to food insecurity and poverty, but income growth does not always improve diet quality in part because consumers cannot directly or immediately observe the health consequences of their food options, especially for newly introduced or reformulated items. Even after direct experience and epidemiological evidence reveals relative risks of dietary patterns and nutritional exposures, many consumers may not consume a healthy diet because food choice is driven by other factors. This chapter reviews the evidence on dietary transition and food system transformation during economic development, drawing implications for how research and practice in agricultural economics can improve nutritional outcomes.},

The World Food Programme, with input from University of California Davis, International Food Policy Research Institute, Epicentre, Harvard University, Mahidol University, Save the Children, and UNICEF, has developed a framework for strengthened nutrition situation analysis and decision making called the “Fill the Nutrient Gap” (FNG), which aims to support identification of strategies to increase availability, access, and choice of nutritious foods, to ultimately improve nutrient intake. The FNG engages stakeholders from different sectors throughout the analytical process to provide input and discuss findings to collectively identify and prioritize context‐specific strategies. The FNG analysis contributes to better understanding the nutrition situation because it (a) focuses on the dietary intake side of the malnutrition framework and analyses in‐depth the nutrient intake of different target groups; (b) linear programming is used in combination with review of secondary data to characterize barriers to nutrient intake, in particular to understand the availability, cost and affordability of nutritious diets for households and target groups with higher nutritional needs, and model potential interventions to improve them; (c) it links the nutrition situation analysis to decision making by providing an evidence base for decision makers to inform their strategies; (d) it facilitates multisectoral discussion on barriers to nutrient intake and enables a prioritization of context‐specific strategies (both nutrition specific and sensitive) to improve the nutrition situation across food, health, and social protection systems.},

abstract = {Since 2020, measuring a population’s access to sufficient nutritious food for an active and healthy life has been done with a new metric known as the Cost and Affordability of Healthy Diets (CoAHD), computed annually for all countries by the World Bank and the FAO, and also used by researchers and national governments to track spatial and temporal variation within countries. This new kind of cost and affordability data measures food access using market prices of the least expensive locally available items that would meet nutritional criteria adopted by national governments, as summarized in a Healthy Diet Basket (HDB) level of intake balanced among six complementary food groups: starchy staples, vegetables, fruits, fats & oils, animal source foods, and legumes, nuts or seeds. CoAHD metrics reflect the definition of food security introduced during the World Food Summit of 1996, and complement earlier measures of global food security used by UN agencies and governments, which are the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) based on total national availability and intake distribution of calories, and the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) based on survey data asking whether a household ran out of resources to acquire their usual diets. This paper briefly discusses the evolution of global food security measurement, then highlights updates to the methods used to compute CoAHD indicators and presents newly available CoAHD data obtained using this methodology and updated price data.},

abstract = {The Chinese Dietary Guidelines propose a balanced diet for healthy living, but the affordability of this diet needs to be considered, especially for low-income households. To investigate the affordability of a healthy diet, this study analyzes the daily retail prices of 46 food items in 36 Chinese cities from 2016 to 2021. This study compares expenditure, diet composition, and nutritional status in two scenarios aligned with the guidelines. The results show that the mean minimum cost of a balanced diet exceeds the current per capita food expenditure for at least 182.85 million urban households. This suggests that low-income people would need to increase their expenditure by at least 20–121% to achieve the recommended diets. This study also identifies affordable and nutrient-dense foods such as standard flour, eggs, black beans, and cabbage, which policymakers should focus on when monitoring food prices. The findings recommend a combination of social and food system policies to reduce prices and make healthy diets accessible. This study identifies the gaps in the Chinese Dietary Guidelines for ensuring accessibility for vulnerable groups and provides a template for policymakers and researchers to track diet affordability using available food price data in China, contributing to China’s 2030 Health Plan and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.},

The final format of the resulting datafile is ready for use in the CoNA protocol. However, we expect this article and associated software tools to be generally useful to social science researchers interested in nutrition-related research questions and the potential implications of food systems’ changes for nutrition. We provide readily usable data files (Supplement 1) containing the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) and guide non-nutrition experts through appropriate use to establish the nutrient needs and assess the adequacy of diets for populations and groups. We complement the DRIs with companion data files (Supplement 2) containing the WHO Child Growth Standards and WHO Growth References for School-Aged Children and Adolescents percentiles tables of anthropometric measures, extract the median heights and weights, and calculate median reference values for the age-sex groups consistent with the DRIs nutrient requirements. We provide calculations of energy requirements using the DRIs Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) equation and WHO growth references for all age-sex groups and physical activity levels. We also calculate the protein Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) per kilogram body weight according to the WHO growth references. For children under two, we provide nutrient needs required from food in Supplement 3. We provide Stata code and R syntax (Supplements 4 and 5) to compile the single data files into usable datasets for statistical analysis. Finally, we also provide data files (Supplement 6) with the recently proposed harmonized average values and upper levels and briefly discuss their potential application.},

abstract = {The cost and affordability of least-cost healthy diets by time and place are increasingly used as a proxy for access to nutrient-adequate diets. Recent work has focused on the nutrient requirements of individuals, although most food and anti-poverty programs target whole households. This raises the question of how the cost of a nutrient-adequate diet can be measured for an entire household. This study identifies upper and lower bounds on the feasibility, cost, and affordability of meeting all household members' nutrient requirements using 2013-2017 survey data from Malawi. Findings show only a minority of households can afford the nutrient-adequate diet at either bound, with 20% of households able to afford the (upper bound) shared diets and 38% the individualized (lower bound) diets. Individualized diets are more frequently feasible with locally available foods (90% vs. 60% of the time) and exhibit more moderate seasonal fluctuation. To meet all members' needs, a shared diet requires a more nutrient-dense combination of foods that is more costly and exhibits more seasonality in diet cost than any one food group or the individualized diets. The findings further help adjudicate the extent to which nutritional behavioral change programs versus broader agricultural and food policies can be relied upon to improve individual access to healthy diets.},

abstract = {A promulgated global shift toward a plant-based diet is largely in response to a perceived negative environmental impact of animal food production, but the nutritional adequacy and economic implications of plant-sourced sustainable healthy dietary patterns need to be considered. This paper reviews recent modeling studies using Linear Programming to determine the respective roles of animal- and plant-sourced foods in developing a least-cost diet in the United States and New Zealand. In both economies, least-cost diets were found to include animal-based foods, such as milk, eggs, fish, and seafood, to meet the energy and nutrient requirements of healthy adults at the lowest retail cost. To model a solely plant-based least-cost diet, the prevailing costs of all animal-sourced foods had to be increased by 1.1 to 11.5 times their original retail prices. This led to the inclusion of fortified plant-based foods, such as fortified soymilk, and a plant-based diet that was considerably (34–45%) more costly. The first-limiting essential nutrients were mostly the vitamins and minerals, with special focus on pantothenic acid, zinc, and vitamin B-12, when transitioning from an animal- and plant-containing least-cost diet to a plant-only based least-cost diet. Modeled least-cost diets based on contemporary food costs include animal-sourced foods, at least for developed high-income US and NZ food economies, and potentially for developing low- and middle-income countries, such as Indonesia. Modeling of least-cost diets that consist exclusively of plant-based foods is feasible, but at a higher daily diet cost, and these diets are often close to limiting for several key nutrients. Diet affordability, as a key dimension of sustainable healthy diets, and the respective economic roles of animal- and plant-sourced foods need to be considered.},

abstract = {Nutrition modeling tools (NMTs) generate evidence to inform policy and program decision making; however, the literature is generally limited to modeling methods and results, rather than use cases and their impacts. We aimed to document the policy influences of 12 NMTs and identify factors influencing them. We conducted semistructured interviews with 109 informants from 30 low‐ and middle‐income country case studies and used thematic analysis to understand the data. NMTs were mostly applied by international organizations to inform national government decision making. NMT applications contributed to enabling environments for nutrition and influenced program design and policy in most cases; however, this influence could be strengthened. Influence was shaped by processes for applying the NMTs; ownership of the analysis and data inputs, and capacity building in NMT methods, encouraged uptake. Targeting evidence generation at specific policy cycle stages promoted uptake; however, where advocacy capacity allowed, modeling was embedded ad hoc into emerging policy discussions and had broader influence. Meanwhile, external factors, such as political change and resource constraints of local partner organizations, challenged NMT implementation. Importantly, policy uptake was never the result of NMTs exclusively, indicating they should be nested persistently and strategically within the wider evidence and advocacy continuum, rather than being stand‐alone activities.},

abstract = {Policies and programs often aim to improve the affordability of nutritious diets, but existing food price indexes are based on observed quantities which may not meet nutritional goals. To measure changes in the cost of reaching international standards of diet quality, we introduce a new Cost of Diet Diversity index based on consuming at least five different food groups as defined by the widely-used Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) indicator, and compare those results with the cost of foods needed to meet an adult woman’s estimated average requirements of essential nutrients and dietary energy. Using national average monthly market price data for Ghana from 2009 through 2014, we find that the relative cost of reaching the MDD-W standard fluctuates seasonally and since mid-2010 has risen about 10 percent per year faster than inflation due to rising relative prices for fruit and fish, while the cost of nutrient adequacy rose even faster due primarily to increase cost of foods rich in vitamin A and calcium. Similar data for Tanzania from 2011 through 2015 show small increases in 2011 and 2012 but stable prices thereafter. Our methods can show where and when nutritious diets are increasingly (un)affordable, and which nutritional criteria account for the change. The specific foods included in each index depend on national price monitoring systems, but the method is generalizable to other contexts for monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of changing food environments.},

abstract = {The aim was to describe the price of homemade street foods in four cities of Central Asia and Eastern Europe and to analyze its association with energy density, macronutrients, sodium and potassium contents. Cross-sectional evaluations of street food vending sites were conducted in Dushanbe, Tajikistan (n = 562), Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (n = 384), Almaty, Kazakhstan (n = 236) and Chișinău, Moldova (n = 89) in 2016–2017. Information on the homemade street foods available, including price, was systematically collected; the most commonly available foods (n = 64) were sampled for chemical analysis. Prices were converted to international dollars ($) and expressed as $/serving, $/100 g and $/100 kcal. The median street food price was $1.00/serving, $0.85/100 g and $0.33/100 kcal. Traditional foods were cheaper per 100 g than the westernized ($0.77 vs. $1.00, p = 0.011). For each unit increase in energy density (kcal/g), the homemade street foods were $0.12 cheaper per 100 kcal and $0.11 more expensive per 100 g. The carbohydrate content was negatively associated with price per 100 kcal, while total fat, monounsaturated, saturated and trans-fatty acids content were positively associated with price per 100 g. Energy-dense homemade street foods were the cheapest. Further insight on food preparation might clarify the association between carbohydrates and monounsaturated fatty acids content and street food price.},
